### Logic

A workspace is a container for projects, clients, and users. It represents a team or organization where multiple users can collaborate.

    Workspace Creation:

        A workspace is not automatically generated when a user creates an account. Instead, the user can create a workspace manually or join an existing one.

        The user who creates the workspace becomes the OWNER of that workspace.

    Workspace Roles:

        OWNER: Full control over the workspace (can add/remove users, create projects, etc.).

        ADMIN: Can manage projects and users but cannot delete the workspace.

        USER: Can view and participate in projects but has limited permissions.

    Workspace Features:

        Create projects.

        Add clients.

        Invite users to the workspace.

        Assign roles to users.
